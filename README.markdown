Planning agent
==============

Summary
-------
This project (simply called 'planning agent' for now) is the result of my desire to
1.  learn and use the Google Go programming language
2.  put to use my recently acquired knowledge about machine learning and artificial intelligence

Right now I do honestly have no idea where this project could useful otherwise, but you are free to
try to use it or components of it in your own projects.

Packages
----------
- ai  package containing implementations of different graph search strategies like A-star search
- ai/planning package containg types and methods to treat planning as a search problem
- collections collections like FIFO queues, priority queues and the like
- loader  util types and functions to load data from persistence
